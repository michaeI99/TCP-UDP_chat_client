As of right now this is a basic TCP server

It's a simple TCP server implementation in C that demonstrates fundamental socket programming concepts.

### Current Functionality

- Creates a TCP socket and binds it to port 8080
- Listens for incoming connections from clients
- Accepts client connections one at a time
- Sends a fixed "Hello from Server!" message to each connecting client
- Closes the connection after sending the message
- Continues listening for new connections

### Planned Features

- Transform into a full chat application
- UDP protocol support
- Persistent connections
- Two-way message exchange
- Multi-client support
- Message encryption
- User authentication
